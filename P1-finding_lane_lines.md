**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

I have a main pipeline(process_image) and an extra pipeline(process_image_test_yellow_and_white) that I
used for the challenge that I will talk about more in the suggested improvements section(#3).

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps:
  - conversion to grayscale
  - filter with gaussian_blur
  - edge detection with canny
  - region of interest filtering
  - line detection with the hough_lines helper function

The image and lines are combined with the weigthed_img helper.

I left all of the help functions intact except for draw_lines().  I modified it to split the lines 
into left and right based on +/- negative slope.  Filter out more horizontal slopes as noise.  Then
for left and right, compute an average y=max intercept(closest to car) and average slope to 
display the combined left and right lane lines.

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline

My pipeline does not deal well with noise.  I have extended the hough parameters to close to
the limit so far that I occasionally have a frame with no line especially on the dashed lane
line.  I did that to help deal with false positive lines.

My main pipeline did not use any color detection to further focus on only the lines we are
interested in, not the lines generated by pavement changes or shadows.

### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

Further work on color filtering could improve some of the noise problems and lack of pickup
of the yellow lane line on the concrete bridge.  That is still a challenging feature to pick
out due to the color of the concrete.  Possibly translations to other color spaces could make
intensity measurement reasonable.

My alternate pipeline implements a color filter for white and yellow using cv2.inrange() and
bitwise or and and to produce a final mask.  This helps considerably on some of the more 
difficult sections of the challenge test data.  However as it is currently tuned it does
cause drop out of line detection in some places and does not completely solve the noisy 
line detection that are present in the challenge video.  I think some further tuning could
help considerably.

Another potential improvement could be to use some form of outlier detection on the left and 
right sets of lines to exclude lines that are too far from the average/mean/median slope.
